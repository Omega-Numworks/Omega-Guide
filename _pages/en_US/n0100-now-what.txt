### GG!

You are already the proud owner of an unlocked Numworks. More specifically, the N0100 model, which came out in 2017.
Due to technical limitations on the hardware of this model, Numworks decided not to lock it. You can now install
a custom firmware like [Omega](https://getomega.dev/install) or Upsilon, if you want.
