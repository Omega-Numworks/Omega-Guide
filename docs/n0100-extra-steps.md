### Why ?

The N0100 is not locked, but, since Epsilon 19, a bug is preventing the installation of some Custom OS with the usual methods.

It all depends on the version of Epsilon installed on the calculator.

### If you have Epsilon 19 or later

There will be some extra steps requires, it will not be long:

We are simply going to install Upsilon from a binary file.

#### Prerequisites

The Upsilon binary file, downloadable on [Upsilon website](https://getupsilon.web.app/), at the bottom of the page.

1. Open the [N0100 WebDFU](https://ti-planet.github.io/webdfu_numworks/n0100/).
2. Connect the calculator in recovery mode by plugging it to your device and pressing RESET.
3. Select the Upsilon binary file you just downloaded.
4. Click on "Flash". Wait until the end of the loading.
5. Unplug your calculator and press RESET.
6. Your calculator now runs Upsilon.

You now have Upsilon on your calculator, but if you wanted another Custom OS or a different config, continue to the next page.

### If you have Epsilon 18 or before

No extra step is required, you can continue.
