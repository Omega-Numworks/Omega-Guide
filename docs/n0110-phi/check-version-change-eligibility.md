### Introduction

You may need to change Epsilon's version to unlock your calculator, we usually install Epsilon 18.2.0. There are some cases where you can install Epsilon 18.2.0 and some you can't, this page explains how to know if you are eligible or not.

### If you have Epsilon 15 or lower

You don't need to change your version, just go to [Now What ?](n0110-now-what)

### If you have Epsilon 16 to 18.2.0 (but not 16.4.3)

You don't need to change your version, just go to [Phi](phi)

### If you have Epsilon 16.4.3 or 18.2.3

You are eligible, you can continue normally

### If you have Epsilon 19 or higher

It depends on the version you had before updating to Epsilon 19 and over.

- If you had 15 or lower, Omega, or Upsilon: You can't change your version
- If you had 16 to 18.2.3 (but not 16.4.3): You can change your version
- If you had 16.4.3, 19 or higher: You can't change your version

### And If you don't know

Don't worry, trying to change your version won't break your calculator.
If you were not eligible, after the process, the calculator will be stuck on Numworks recovery screen and you will be able to update from Numworks website and your calculator will work normally.
